# Overview
The opendihu-webapp is part of my Bachelor Thesis "Webapplication for multiphysics simulations with opendihu".

[Opendihu](https://github.com/maierbn/opendihu) is a software framework that solves static and dynamic multi-physics problems, spatially discretized in 1D, 2D and 3D by the finite element method.

This Project aims to simplify the creation of a new simulation in opendihu for end users by visualizing the nested solver-structures and parameters of simulations.
